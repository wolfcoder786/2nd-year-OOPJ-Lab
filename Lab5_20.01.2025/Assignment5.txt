1.Crate an abstract class 'student' with two data members roll no, reg no, a method getinput() and an abstract method course(). A subclass 'kiitian' with course() method implementation. Write the driver class to print the all details of a kiitian object.
Input -  Rollno 2205180 
Registration no 1234567890
Output -Rollno 2205180 
Registration no 1234567890
Course B.Tech. (Computer Science & Engg)
2.Define an abstract Bank class having a method as getRateOfInterest(). Create two classes SBI and PNB which extend Bank class and implement the getRateOfInterest method.
Input mentioned in the program
Output The rate of interest of the bank is ---
3.Create an abstract class shape with a blank method called calcArea(). Derive two child class named as Circle and Triangle which will overrides the method and display the area accordingly.
